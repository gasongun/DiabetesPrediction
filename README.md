Pregnancy also effects the diabetes and increase the diasease chance.

 ## BUSINESS PROBLEM:

We want to predict what is the probability of having diabetes above 21 years old females.

## DATASET STORY :

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in United States. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage lives in Phoneix. 
Dependent variable is a Outcome variable on the dataset and 1 means the patient has a diabetes, 0 means the patient has no diabetes. 

## VARIABLES:

* Pregnancies – Number of pregnancies the patient has had
* Glucose – Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness – Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin – 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: – Diabetes pedigree function
* Age – Age (years)
* Outcome: Having the diabetes (1) or not (0)
